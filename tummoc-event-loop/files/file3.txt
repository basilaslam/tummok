Mother Teresa - The Saint of the Gutters Who Devoted Her Life to Serving the Poor

Mother Teresa, born on August 26, 1910, in Skopje, now part of North Macedonia, was a remarkable humanitarian and the founder of the Missionaries of Charity. She dedicated her life to caring for the most vulnerable and marginalized people,

 especially those living in poverty in Kolkata, India.

Known as the "Saint of the Gutters," Mother Teresa's selfless devotion and compassion inspired millions worldwide.

 She provided food, shelter, and medical care to the poor, sick, and dying, establishing numerous hospices, orphanages,
 
  and centers for people with leprosy.

Her work transcended religious boundaries, and she became a symbol of love, mercy, and service to humanity. Mother Teresa

 received numerous honors and awards, including the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979, for her tireless efforts to alleviate suffering and bring hope to those in need.
